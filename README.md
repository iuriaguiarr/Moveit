# Time to Move

Application developed during the fourth edition of Next Level Week, carried out by Rocketseat.

It consists of the gamification of the Pomodoro Method, granting XP to the user after the conclusion of each cycle, and its respective objective.

In the future, I intend to add an authentication system and also a ranking system, enabling the division by leagues.

## For this project the following technologies were used:
* React: For creating interfaces;
* NextJS: For simplification and hosting on Vercel's servers;

## Usage
